        <h2>Fascinating Facts About The Moon:</h2>
        <p>
            1.The moon probably formed in a giant collision The most widely accepted explanation for how the moon
            formed is called the giant-impact theory, which proposes that a Mars-size planet collided with the early
            Earth, forming a cloud of debris that eventually coalesced into the moon. Much of the debris would have come
            from the colliding planet, but some would have originated from Earth and been ejected into space during the
            collision, according to the Natural History Museum in London.

            Evidence of this impact can be found in the moon samples taken during the Apollo missions, which show that
            the moon's composition has similarities to and differences from Earth's geological composition.
            <br><br>
            2.The moon's phases depend on its position
            The phases of the moon are determined by where the moon is in relation to Earth and the sun. If Earth is
            directly between the sun and the moon, the side of the moon facing Earth is fully illuminated and we see a
            full moon. But if the moon is between Earth and the sun, the illuminated side faces away from us and it is a
            new moon, meaning we don't see the moon at all.

            In between a new moon and a full moon, different portions of the part of the moon the sun illuminates are
            visible from Earth, creating the moon's phases. When the moon appears to increase in size until it is full,
            it is said to be waxing; when it is decreasing, it is waning.
            <br><br>
            3.The "dark" side of the moon is not actually dark
            Although we see only one side of the moon, half of it is always illuminated by the sun, and it's not usually
            just the portion we can see (except during the full moon). Therefore, the "dark" side of the moon is dark
            only from our perspective on Earth.

            Instead, it's more accurate to call it the far side of the moon. Even though we can't see that side from
            Earth, several missions have photographed and studied the far side of the moon, with the first photos of the
            lunar far side taken by the Soviet Union's Luna 3 space probe in 1959.
